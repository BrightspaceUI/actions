# Branch Protection and Release Workflows

**The below is how you should configure your release workflow in the `Brightspace` org - for now. The `BrightspaceUI`, `BrightspaceUILabs` and `BrightspaceHypermediaComponents` orgs should use the new [release token steps](./release-token).**

Included in the [semantic-release](../semantic-release/), [incremental-release](../incremental-release), and [match-lms-release](https://github.com/Brightspace/lms-version-actions/tree/main/match-lms-release) workflows is a step which updates the version in your repo's `package.json` file to match the newly released version. This step will fail with the built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN` if your repo has branch protection rules that prevent commits outside of pull requests.

To work around this, we use a special `D2L_GITHUB_TOKEN`.

To set up this bypass:

1. Ensure that `D2L_GITHUB_TOKEN` is a secret available to your repo

    For repos in `Brightspace`, `BrightspaceUI`, `BrightspaceUILabs` and `BrightspaceHypermediaComponents` this secret will already be available org-wide.

    We plan to automate the configuration and rotation of this secret in the future.

2. Configure access to the `brightspace-bot`

    This is also a temporary step, but make sure that the `brightspace-bot` GitHub account has Admin access to your repo by going to Settings -> Collaborators and teams -> Add people.

    Also double-check that your branch protection rules (in Branches -> main -> Edit) do not include "Do not allow bypassing the above settings", meaning admins are also forced to open pull requests and wait for status checks. This will cause the release job to fail.

3. Set `persist-credentials` to `false` in the checkout step:

    ```yml
    - name: Checkout
      uses: Brightspace/third-party-actions@actions/checkout
      with:
        persist-credentials: false
    ```

    This tells GitHub Actions not to set up the default `GITHUB_TOKEN`.

4. Pass in `D2L_GITHUB_TOKEN` as the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable to the release step:

    ```yml
    - name: Semantic/Incremental Release
      uses: BrightspaceUI/actions/semantic-release@main (or incremental-release)
      with:
        GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.D2L_GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    ```

That should do it!
