# Prepare Translations for NPM Action

This GitHub action prepares translation files in a project for NPM publishing by creating temporary `en` translations for each language term and each language
in your project that doesn't yet have a proper translation.

## Using the Action

Typically this action is called from a release workflow before a step which publishes to NPM, such as the [semantic-release action](https://github.com/BrightspaceUI/actions/tree/master/semantic-release).


Here's a sample workflow:

```yml
name: Release
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master
jobs:
  release:
    timeout-minutes: 2
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: Brightspace/third-party-actions@actions/checkout
        with:
          persist-credentials: false
      - name: Setup Node
        uses: Brightspace/third-party-actions@actions/setup-node
        # additional validation steps can be run here
      - name: Prepare Translations for NPM
        uses: BrightspaceUI/actions/prepare-translations-for-npm@master
        with:
          LANG_PATH: lang
        # NPM publishing step happens here
```

Options:
* `LANG_PATH` (default: `lang`): The relative path to your language files from the root of your repository

Notes:
* If you have additional release validation steps (e.g. build step, validation tests), run them before the "Prepare Translations for NPM" step.
* You must run the checkout step before running the "Prepare Translations for NPM" step, otherwise the action will not be able to find your lang path.
* Don't run this action if you're not publishing to NPM. It doesn't commit to your repo and isn't relevant outside of publishing to NPM.

## Lang File Format

This action expects the following format for lang files:
* All lang files should be contained within the top level of the `LANG_PATH` directory. This action does not support language files within nested directories (e.g. `{LANG_PATH}/es/es.js`, `{LANG_PATH}/en/en.js` would not be supported).
* Lang files must be JavaScript modules, formatted as outlined in the [localize mixin documentation](https://github.com/BrightspaceUI/core/blob/master/mixins/localize-mixin.md).
* Languages not included in the default list within the `prepare-translations.js` script within this action will not be prepared for translation. Please ensure any new languages are added to that list.
* Language files with empty default exports should be created for all supported languages, even those that don't currently have translations. This action will not fail if language files are missing in your repo, but will also not attempt to prepare default translations for those languages.
