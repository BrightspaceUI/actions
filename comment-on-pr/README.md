# Comment On PR Action

This GitHub action uses the [GitHub REST API](https://octokit.github.io/rest.js/v19#issues-create-comment) to add a comment to the current PR as the `github-actions` user, with an option to only post once per PR.

## Using the Action

This action **can only be used on `pull_request` event types**, since it posts to the PR that triggers the action. It can be used to write any comment, and can be combined with other steps in your workflow to convey information from your CI process.

Here's a sample workflow:

```yml
name: Comment
on: pull_request
jobs:
  comment:
    timeout-minutes: 5
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Comment on PR
        uses: BrightspaceUI/actions/comment-on-pr@main
        with:
          message: |
            Thanks for the PR! ðŸŽ‰

            This is a sample multi-line comment.
          post-mode: once
```

### Options

* `message` (required): The message to display
* `post-mode` (default: `always`): How posting of the comment will be handled. Options are `always`, `once`, `hide-previous` or `update`. See [below](#post-mode) for details
* `unique-key` (default: `gh-actions_comment-on-pr`): A unique key attached invisibly to the comment, for use with the `post-mode` option

#### Post Mode

Every comment from this action includes a hidden key in an HTML comment, which is used by `post-mode` to detect if a post has already been created. Use `unique-key` to specify your own unique key, which can be useful e.g. if you want to uniquely post two different comments.

* `always`: This will result in a comment always being posted to the pull request. This is the default mode
* `once`: The first time the action is run it will post the comment but in subsequent runs it will not post anything
* `hide-previous`: This will always look for a previous comment with the specified `unique-key` and hide it before posting a new comment with the most recent content
* `update`: This will find a previous comment with the specified `unique-key` and update the contents of the comment
