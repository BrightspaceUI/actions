# Comment On PR Action

This GitHub action uses the [GitHub REST API](https://octokit.github.io/rest.js/v19#issues-create-comment) to add a comment to the current PR as the `github-actions` user, with an option to only post once per PR.

## Using the Action

This action **can only be used on `pull_request` event types**, since it posts to the PR that triggers the action. It can be used to write any comment, and can be combined with other steps in your workflow to convey information from your CI process.

In situations where you only want to post once on a given PR, use `only-post-once: true`. Every comment from this action includes a hidden key in an HTML comment, which is used by `only-post-once` to detect if a post has already been created. Use `unique-key` to specify your own unique key, which can be useful e.g. if you want to uniquely post two different comments.

Here's a sample workflow:

```yml
name: Comment
on: pull_request
jobs:
  comment:
    timeout-minutes: 5
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Comment on PR
        uses: BrightspaceUI/actions/comment-on-pr@main
        with:
          MESSAGE: |
            Thanks for the PR! ðŸŽ‰

            This is a sample multiline comment.
          ONLY_POST_ONCE: true
```

Options:

* `message` (required): The message to display
* `only-post-once` (default: `false`): Check whether the current message has already been posted before posting again
* `unique-key` (default: `"gh-actions_comment-on-pr"`): A unique key attached invisibly to the comment, for use with the `only-post-once` option
